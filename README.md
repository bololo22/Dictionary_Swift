Coding Challenge provided. The app finds a word in the dictionary using a Robot Interface.

A sophisticated robot for looking up terms and definitions from a physical copy of Merriam-Webster's English Dictionary was provided. The robot is able to:

 - Turn the pages forward and backward.
 - Move over the terms on the current page, up and down. 
 - "Jump" to the first or last page. 
 - "Jump" to the first or last term on the current page. 
 - Read one term (and it's definition) at a time.

I implemented the findDefinition(), modified the UI to make it more appealing and use DelegatesImplementations to perform the search and update the UI to show the status of where the Robot is. 
I also added function to the Robot to make it more efficient.
